# Password Generator Starter Code
Need to create an event listener on a button
create a series of window.prompts for password criteria
use boolean to create which criteria the user want to use
window prompt asking the user how many characters min 8, max 128 characters
use a funtion to verfiy the input
use the confirm prompt to have the user decide which criteria wants 
take their input and use it in the boolean variable
if the user doesn't select any criteria/variables come back false, enter a return nothing
create a new function and insert the password criterias as the parameters
need to make an array for each set (lowercase, uppercase,special characters)
create an empty array list that stores the password
then create a for loop that runs as many times as there are characters inputted
create an array that generates the password
